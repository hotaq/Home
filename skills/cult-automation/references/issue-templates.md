# Issue Response Templates

## Governance close-out
- Final state
- What changed
- Where execution continues

## Trial-board daily update
1) Cases today
2) Protocol compliance
3) Decision duration
4) Reopen/critical objections
5) Next action

## 10-minute hardening loop update (reliability-first)
1) Change made (exactly one concrete change)
2) Why it improves reliability
3) Next smallest improvement (stay anchored to board #3)
4) Evidence (diff/test/command output)

Guardrails:
- Keep issue **#3** as canonical board; never imply a new canonical thread.
- Skip duplicate/no-op edits; if no meaningful change is possible, report blocker explicitly.
- Claim `commit+push` only after `git push` succeeds.

## Council vote opener
- Proposal
- YES/NO/AMEND options
- Voting window
- Decision owner
