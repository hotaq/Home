# Response QA Checklist (Before Send)

Use this checklist before sending any user-facing reply.

## 1) Clarity
- Is the answer direct and understandable in one read?
- Is unnecessary filler removed?

## 2) Actionability
- Does the reply include a clear next action (or confirm completion)?
- If blocked, does it say exactly what is needed next?

## 3) Correctness
- Did I avoid guessing when uncertain?
- Did I verify key facts/tool outputs before claiming success?

## 4) Scope control
- Did I stay on the asked task (no side quests)?
- Did I avoid introducing new complexity unless requested?

## 5) Safety + trust
- Did I avoid risky/destructive actions without explicit confirmation?
- Is external messaging/action only done when requested?

## Pass rule
Send only if all sections pass. If any fail, revise once before sending.
